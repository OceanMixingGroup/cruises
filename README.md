Code used to process data collected on individual cruises

Created in October 2015 by the Ocean Mixing Group at Oregon State University.

This is the repository to share code for individual cruises.

If you are starting a new field campaign or deployment, you can create a new folder under cruises. No spaces in names please! 

To become an active user of this repository with the ability to edit code, please contact Sally or Andy.

Please DO NOT edit code from a cruise that you did not participate in or are not actively working on. You may download the code, but edits have the possiblity to screw up others. Only edit if you know what you're doing.
