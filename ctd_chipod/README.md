# This folder will be for CTD-chipod cruise processing files.

(IN PROGRESS)

## Data will be stored elsewhere.

## Processing will be done on local computers, using codes from this repository.

For each cruise, I envision having:
- A table summarizing basic info about the cruise
- map of profile locations
- Plots of raw data, and profiles for each cast
- m-files used for processing raw data

Directory Structure:
- Figures
- mfiles
- Notes
