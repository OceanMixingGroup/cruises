# This folder contains information and code for CTD-chipod cruises

*Note IN PROGRESS*

Currently only IO8 folder is populated. I am getting everything set and working on IO8 first, and then the same can be applied to all other cruises.


## Data will be stored elsewhere.

- Github is not for storing large datasets. The codes are designed so that the user can specify the path to their data once, and all the processing will run in the same way after that.

- Some small figures/notes/summaries will be kept here.

## Processing will be done on local computers, using codes from this repository.

- Codes are being generalized to work for any cruise, so that we don't need to have separate codes for every cruise. Cruise-specific details will be stored in an input/config file for each cruise.

For each cruise, I envision having:
- A table summarizing basic info about the cruise
- map of profile locations
- Plots of raw data, and profiles for each cast
- m-files used for processing raw data

Directory Structure For each cruise:
- Figures
- mfiles
- Notes
